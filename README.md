# Domain Adaptability

Measure the similarity between two corpora (text datasets). The measures work best when each corpus is at least 10k words. This package support 74 languages.

    from domain_adaptability import Adaptability
    cs = Adaptability(language = "eng")

    result = cs.calculate(corpus1, corpus2)

The package contains all preprocessing and training. Only the language needs to be specified. A list of supported languages is provided below.

Domain Adaptability module is derived from the [Corpus Similarity repository](https://github.com/jonathandunn/corpus_similarity.git), 
a project by Jonathan Dunn, Haipeng Li, Damian Sastre.

Corpus Similarity builds on top of the corpus similarity measure is a simple character n-gram comparison, with the best performance coming with using Spearman's Rho as a measure of correlation. The original idea for this kind of corpus comparison comes from Adam Kilgarriff (https://kilgarriff.co.uk/Publications/2001-K-CompCorpIJCL.pdf). 

Recent work in *Lingua* has evaluated the measures used in this package extensively in a multi-lingual setting (https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04332). These measures have since been used to model the relationship between registers in a multi-lingual setting (https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09813) and to validate geo-referenced corpus collections (https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01294). Other work has modelled the relationship between corpus similarity (upstream) and embedding similarity (downstream) (https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04330). These papers provide further details for the theory and evaluation behind this package.

# Input

The **Adaptability.calculate** method requires two input corpora. These can be:
    
    - a list of strings
    - a filename of one of the following formats:
        - .txt
        - .gz
        - .json
        - .jsonl
        - .csv
    - a dataset of the huggingface/datasets library

# Output

The output is a scalar measure of how adaptable the two corpora are. The values fall between 0 (very different) and 1 (very adaptable). The values are consistent within languages, but not across languages. For example, Swedish has higher relative adaptability than Estonian.
